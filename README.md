# Machine Learning Project - Credit Card Churn

## Background

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for any business. It can be difficult for established businesses with a broad customer base to identify customers at risk. In this project, we used a dataset of credit card customers to develop a **machine learning** model that predicts if a customer is going to leave or stay with the business.

[Our dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers) consists of 10,000 existing and attrited customers. It includes 23 columns including their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc.

## Data Exploration

We have 5 steps in data exploration:

- Variable Identification (in word file in google drive)
- [Univariate Analysis in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/will.bobzin#!/vizhome/Bank_churn_exploration_dash1/Dashboard1?publish=yes) 
- Bi-variate Analysis (Python file in data exploration)
- Missing Values treatment (in Python file)
- Outlier treatment (in python file)
